# Reversi
This is an AI written in Java that plays reversi game using the ideology of maximizing and minimizing, as well as alpha_beta plunging. Enter "javac Othello.java" on your terminal, then enter "java Othello" to play this game. Theoretically speaking, there's very little chance for you to win this game against the AI, but I still hope you can enjoy yourself while playing it. If you love my code, please follow me on GitHub, thanks very much!
